CHAPTER 10: PDP-15 CONSOLE
##########################


The PDP-15 console (see Figure 10-1) provides access to, or control over,
virtually every portion of the PDP-15. All registers, buses, and controls are
multiplexed down a single console cable to display the equivalence of 24
registers and 34 control functions. The console provides extensive control for
real-time debugging and comprehensive man-machine interaction during checkout.


INFORMATION/CONTROL SWITCHES
============================

The following two-position rocker switches are on the console keyboard:

Number  Designation     Number  Designation
18      Data            1       Repeat
15      Address         1       Halt Loop
1       Clock           1       Single Time
1       Register Group  1       Single Step
1       Parity Error    1       Single Instruction

Data
----
These 18 switches may be read indirectly into the accumulator by the execution
of a OAS (OR accumulator content with switches content) instruction in an
operating program. Data may be inserted manually into the machine with these
switches by means of the DEPOSIT and DEPOSIT NEXT keys.

Address
-------

The memory address required by the START, READ IN, EXAMINE, and DEPOSIT keys is
supplied by these switches. When one of these keys is depressed, the address
given by the address switches is loaded into the MA (memory address) register
and the key instruction is executed.

Register Group
--------------

Selects which of two groups of 12 registers to be selected by the register
select switch. In the OFF position the normal registers may be viewed while the
ON position allows viewing of the maintenance registers. (See Register Select
Switch).

Clock
------

The ON position disables the real-time clock from issuing program interupt (PI)
requests.

Parity Error
------------

The ON position disables parity error program interrupts from occurring.

Repeat
------

With this switch in the ON position, the processor will repeat the key function
depressed by the operator at the rate specified by the repeat clock.

Start - program execution will restart at the repeat speed after the machine halts.

Execute - the instruction in the data switches will be executed at the repeat
        clock rate.

Continue - program execution will continue at the repeat speed after halting.

Deposit: This, Next. Examine: This, Next - the Deposit, Deposit Next or Examine
        Next function will be repeated.

Depressing STOP or turning off the repeat switch will halt the repeat action.

Halt Loop
----------

Used in conjunction with single time, step or instruction. Enabling the halt
loop switch and any one of the other three will cause the processor to
continually repeat the time, step or instruction into which it has been
advanced.

Single Time
-----------

Halts execution of the program after each time state has been completed.

Single Step
------------

Halts execution of the program after each major state has been completed.

Single Instruction
------------------

Halts program execution after each instruction has been completed.


OPERATE CONTROL SWITCHES
=========================

The following momentary contact switches are on the console panel.

Number  Designation     Number  Designation

1       Start           1       Read In
1       Execute         1       Deposit This
1       Continue        1       Deposit Next
1       Stop            1       Examine This
1       Reset           1       Examine Next
                        1       Protect

Start
------

Initiates program execution at the location specified by the address switches.

Execute
-------

Executes the instruction in the data switches and halts after execution.

Continue
--------

Resumes program execution from the location specified by the program counter
(PC). Also used to advance machine while in single time, step or instruction.

Stop
----

Halts the processor after the completion of the present instruction.

Reset
-----

Generates a power clear signal which clears all active registers and all control
flip-flops except the program counter (PC).

Read-in
-------

Initiates the read-in of paper tape punched in binary code (each set of three
6-bit lines read from tape forms one 18-bit computer word). Storage of words
read-in begins at the memory location specified by the ADDRESS switches. At the
completion of tape read-in, the processor reads the last word entered and
executes it.

Deposit
-------

Deposits the contents of the data switches into the memory location specified by
the address switches. After the transfer, the memory locations address is in the
OA (operand address) register and the contents of the accumulator switches are
in the MO (memory out) register.

Deposit Next
------------

Deposits the contents of the data switches into the location given by OA ±1.
This permits the loading of sequential memory locations without the need of
loading the address each time.

Examine
-------

Places the contents of the memory location specified by the address switches
into the memory buffer register. The address is loaded into the OA (operand
address) register.

Examine Next
------------

Places the contents of the memory location specified by the OA + 1 (operand
address plus 1) into the memory buffer register. Sequential memory locations may
be examined using the Examine-Next switch.

Protect
-------

Initiates the memory protect feature. When utilized, the protect feature
prevents the read-in of data into the specified "protected" memory locations.


SPECIAL SWITCHES
================

Register Select
---------------

The 12 position Register Select rotary switch can select the following registers
for viewing in the REGISTER indicators (under control of the Register Group
switch).

Register Group Switch OFF:

    AC      Accumulator
    PC      Program Counter
    OA      Operand Address
    MQ      Multiplexer Quotient
    L, SC   Priority Level/Step Counter
    XR      Index Register
    LR      Limit Register
    EAE     EAE
    DSR     Data Storage Register
    IOB     I/O Bus
    STA     I/O Status
    MO      Memory Out

Register Group Switch ON:

    A BU    A Bus
    B BU    B Bus
    C BU    C Bus
    SFT     Shift Bus
    IOA     I/O Address
    SUM     Sum Bus
    MI      Maintenance I
    M2      Maintenance II
    MDL     Memory Data Lines
    MA      Memory Address
    MB      Memory Buffer
    MST     Memory Status

Maintenance 1 and 2
---------------------

Two positions of the Register Select switch MI and M2, in conjunction with the
Single Time switch, provide a visual display of active control and gating signal
levels. For a given instruction, as the processor is stepped through the time
states of each major state, the REGISTER indicators display a predictable
sequence of enabling and strobing signals. The visual display relieves personnel
of a large portion of the signal tracing normally associated with the
maintenance of electronic systems. The sequences or maintenance "status words",
are supplied as part of the system maintenance data.

Power/Repeat Rate
-----------------

A variable-pot/switch provides the POWER ON/ OFF control at one end of its
rotation and variable repeat speed (approximately 1 Hz to 10 kHz) over the
remainder of its rotation.
