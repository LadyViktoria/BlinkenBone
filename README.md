# BlinkenBone - Extend the SimH simulator with real or simulated console panels.

"BlinkenBone" is an architecture to connect simulators of vintage computers (yes, SimH!)
with "Blinkenlight panels".

The panels can be vintage physical panels enhanced with modern micro-Linux controllers,
or graphical Java simulations of the panels.

The interface between simulator and panel is a network-base client/server model.

At the moment, DEC PDP-11/40, PDP-11/70, DEC PDP-10/KI10 and PDP-8/I are available.
Sources and precompiled distributions for Win32, Ubuntu and RaspberryPi can be downloaded.
